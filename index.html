    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The Vegetable Kingdom is currently ruled by King Pea, a cunning and proud leader who prioritizes the interests of his vegetable clan above all else. Under his rule, vegetables enjoy power and privilege, but this comes at the cost of the fruits, who are often overworked and excluded from political influence.</p>

    <p>Chief Nana, a strong-willed fruit, refuses to accept this injustice. Frustrated by the ongoing vegetable supremacy, he has secretly organized a resistance group called The Fruit Force (TFF), aimed at challenging King Peaâ€™s authority and restoring balance to the kingdom. Their mission is dangerous and uncertain, but their hope is strong.</p>

    <p>Adding to the tension is a mysterious new character, already teased on Telegram, whose true motives and allegiances remain unknown. This figure promises to bring new twists to the story and could change the fate of the entire kingdom.</p>
